## Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio repository! This repository showcases various projects and analyses I've worked on related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis. Each project includes detailed Jupyter notebooks with explanations, code, and visualizations.

Projects Included

1. Project 1: SPACEX Falcon 9 Predictions (Graduation Project)
   - Description: Predicting whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. In this project I performed Exploratory Data Analysis where I collected data on the Falcon 9 first-stage landings. I use a RESTful API and web scraping and converted the data into a dataframe and then performed some data wrangling. I built a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash and built an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium. Moving on to the final stage of Predictive Analysis, in which I used machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. I splited the data into training data and test data to find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Then find the method that performs best using test data.

4. **Project 4:** Australia Wildfire
   - Project Description: Australia Wildfires Dashboard and Analysis

This project analyzes data from the 2005 Australia wildfires and builds a comprehensive dashboard to visualize wildfire activities across different regions. The dataset includes key metrics such as estimated fire area, fire brightness, radiative power, and confidence levels for vegetation fires, providing insights into wildfire patterns and their intensity over time.

### Key aspects of the project:
1. Data Analysis: Historical wildfire data is processed and analyzed to uncover trends, including regional variations, seasonal impacts, and patterns in fire activity.
2. Visualization: A user-friendly dashboard is developed to present the data interactively. The dashboard highlights metrics such as mean fire brightness, estimated fire areas, and confidence levels, enabling stakeholders to explore data by region and time.
3. Insights Generation: Statistical measures, including standard deviation and variance of radiative power, are computed to evaluate the reliability and variability of the data.
4. Data Quality Assessment: The dataset's replaced data indicator is used to ensure higher-quality insights are derived when updated information becomes available.

The project leverages Python and libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and dashboard tools to analyze and visualize the data. This analysis aims to support decision-making in disaster management and wildfire prevention strategies.
