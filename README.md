# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio repository! This repository showcases various projects and analyses I've worked on related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis. Each project includes detailed Jupyter notebooks with explanations, code, and visualizations.

## Projects Included

### Project 1: SPACEX Falcon 9 Predictions (Graduation Project)
**Description:** Predicting whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis, collected data using a RESTful API and web scraping, and built a dashboard for interactive analysis. I also used machine learning to predict the success of the first-stage landing.

**Technologies:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, Folium, Plotly, HTML, Webscraping, REST API, EDA, Machine Learning, Predictive Analysis, dash, SQL, Databases.
